**THIS PROJECT CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK, IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**.

See <https://github.com/howerj/lfsr> for more information.

The intention is to get the system described in my other LFSR project up and
running in VHDL on an FPGA. This should run Forth. A lot of code has been
borrowed from <https://github.com/howerj/subleq-vhdl>.
